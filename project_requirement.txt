Requirement Document: Generative AI Chatbot for Customer Support

1. Objective

Build a basic chatbot using a Generative AI model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) that can converse naturally with users. The chatbot will be deployed as a web application with a REST API backend.
The chatbot will serve as a first-line assistant for customer support, capable of responding to frequently asked questions, assisting users in generating support tickets, and escalating to human agents when necessary. The system is aimed at reducing the load on human agents by handling simple queries and ensuring seamless ticket creation for complex issues.
Key features include:

• FAQ Handling: Respond to frequent user questions (e.g., shipping, refund, return policy).
• Ticket Creation: If the chatbot cannot resolve a user's issue, it will create a support ticket containing the user's message and a timestamp.
• Ticket Acknowledgment: The chatbot will confirm ticket creation and share a ticket ID with the user.
• Human Escalation: If needed, the chatbot can inform the user that their issue will be reviewed by a human support agent.

2. High Level Flow of the Chatbot

[Description of flowchart: The flowchart is divided into two main parts - User Interaction and Support Escalation.

In User Interaction:
- Starts with "User sends message or retry".
- Goes to "Backend Processing: Backend API receives message".
- Then to a decision diamond: "Can AI answer the query?"
- If yes: "Use LLM to generate response" -> "Return response to frontend".
- If no: Leads to Support Escalation.

In Support Escalation:
- "Create support ticket" -> "Save issue and timestamp" -> "Send ticket ID to user" -> "Notify human agent if needed".

3. Functional Requirements

1. Use Case 1: Ask Information About a Support Ticket

Input: Ticket ID from user
Output: Return status message (stubbed/static for MVP)

2. Use Case 2: Create a New Support Ticket

Triggered when AI cannot resolve issue
Generates ticket ID, stores issue message, and returns ID to user

3. Use Case 3: View Chat History

For MVP, basic session-level chat log shown (not persisted across refresh)

In the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version:

• The chatbot will maintain the chat messages only for the current session.
• The conversation is not stored in a database or file, so once the session ends (e.g., user refreshes the page, closes the browser, or times out), the chat history is lost.

4. Sample Chat Conversation

Use Case 1: Asking Information About a Support Ticket

User: Hi, I want to check the status of my support ticket.

Use Case 2: Request for Creating a New Support Ticket

User: I’m unable to log into my account.
Bot: I’m sorry to hear that. Would you like me to create a support ticket for you?
User: Yes, please.
Bot: Got it. I’ve created a support ticket for your issue. Your reference number is TCKT-20250723-001. Our support team will contact you soon.

Use Case 3: View Chat History (Session-Based)

User: Hi

• Edge Case Handling - Complex, ambiguous, or multi-intent queries
• FAQ Coverage - Ensure all frequently asked questions are properly addressed
• Escalation Triggers - Verify when human agents should be involved
